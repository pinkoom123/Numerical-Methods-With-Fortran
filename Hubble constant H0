#Hubble constant H0

This program estimates the Hubble constant H0H0​ from observed data of galaxy distances and recession velocities using a linear fit. It reads the data from a file, performs the linear regression, calculates standard errors, and outputs results. Here's a breakdown of each section:
Code Explanation:

    #Data Reading:
        The program reads data for galaxy distances (d) and velocities (s) from hubble_data.txt.
        N = 15 assumes there are 15 data points in the file. This value can be adjusted if needed.

    #Linear Fit Calculation:
        Sets up a system of equations AX=BAX=B for the linear fit.
        Matrix AA is based on the sums of distances and their squares, while BB holds sums of velocities and the products of distances and velocities.
        Solves for X, where X(1) is the intercept (β1β1​) and X(2) is the slope (β2β2​, the Hubble constant).

   # Coefficient of Determination R2R2:
        Computes R2R2 as a measure of fit quality by comparing the variance explained by the fit with the total variance in the data.

   # Standard Errors for Parameters:
        Calculates the standard errors for the slope and intercept, which are essential for assessing the reliability of β1β1​ and H0H0​.

    #Output Results:
        Writes the estimated parameters, their standard errors, and R2R2 to fit.txt.
        Outputs key results to the console as well.

#Output Example in fit.txt:

#This file will have:

    The estimated intercept (beta1).
    The Hubble constant (beta2).
    Standard errors for both parameters.
    The coefficient of determination (R^2), which indicates the model's goodness of fit.

#How to Run:

    Prepare hubble_data.txt with columns for distances and speeds in the correct format.
    Compile and run the program.
    Check fit.txt for results and verify R^2 for a good fit.

#Key Points:

    R^2 Interpretation: Values closer to 1 indicate a better fit.
    Standard Errors: Smaller errors indicate more reliable parameter estimates.
